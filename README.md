# This is a forked version of the Olympus package
Please see the folder [`case_study_pwas`](https://github.com/mjzhu-p/olympus/tree/pwas_comp/case_studies/case_study_pwas/z_comparisonStudy) under ``case_studies`` for the detailed comparison studies reported in the paper "_Discrete and mixed-variable experimental design with surrogate-based approach_"

Please see the [main repository](https://github.com/MolChemML/ExpDesign) for the explanation of the case studies.

**Note**:
* for **_EDBO_**, minor updates are required for the `bro.py` file to be able to specify the number of initial samples. See the specifics at https://github.com/mjzhu-p/edbo/tree/pwas_comp
* for **_Olympus_** package modified here, some updates are only needed for Windows systems (see the commit `2615b001fcfd9754a03f5a4b43b69c30afd4d993` adopted from [@felix-s-k](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/olympus/pull/34) , you can revert changes in this commit if you are using a Linux system).
